# Full Stack Fitness App

This webapp is a tracking app for weightlifting. Specifically, it is a variant of the Starting Strength program. Users make an account and then they can perform workouts and save their progress in the app. The app suggests personalized weight and set/rep schemas that roughly follow the Starting Strength program.

I used MongoDB and Express for the back end and I used Vue for the front end.

For more information, see my individual Beginning Brawn repos.
